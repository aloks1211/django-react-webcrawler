This is a set up so that we can easily create apps that use Django on the backend
and React (set up with create-react-app) for the front end application.

## Running
docker-compose build

docker-compose up

##### There should now be two servers running:

http://127.0.0.1:8000 is the Django app

http://127.0.0.1:3000 is the React app
